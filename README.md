# Data_structures-Python-
This repository contains my implementations of basic data structures in Python, which I organized for training purposes. 

level_1 contains implementations of such structures as: a 
- two-linked list; 
- ordered list and tests; 
- dynamic array;
- stack; 
- queue; 
- hash table; 
- bloom filter; 
- associative array(dictionary); 
- and a set. 

level_2 contains implementations of such structures as: 
- tree and tests; 
- binary tree and search; 
- balanced tree; 
- tree traversal algorithm; 
- width search algorithm; 
- depth search algorithm; 
- heap; 
- graph.
